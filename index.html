            <h2>I'm learning how to code web development</h2>
            <p><h4>Hi everyone, my name is Tom and I'm so excited for you to see my first real website. I started my coding journey on the 21st of May 2024 and I can't wait to create more projects, and see where this incredible journey may lead.
               At first coding seemed intimidating and somewhat daunting. But having found a japanese philosophy called "Kaizen" which means continuous improvement; or improving oneself 1% everyday. I believe anything is possible and that the path 
               of your resistance is the most rewarding. Its the journey, not the destination. I aspire to be a Web Developer one day and I wish fellow programmers the best on your coding journeys as well.</h4</p>

                <h4>
                <li>Avatar</li>
                </h4>
                <p>Incredible Sci-fi movie, I love the visuals, worldbuilding and soundtrack. Best movie ever.</p>
                <h4>
                <li>Dune Part 2</li>
                </h4>
                <p>Another Sci-fi epic, everything Avatar just inverted. Desert, sandworms, political tensions, incredible soundtrack.</p>
                <h4>
                <li>Lord of The Rings</li>
                </h4>
                <p>Third and final movie in the trilogy, everything was perfect and no other trilogy will top what LOTR has accomplished. All in all the last scene's soundtrack leaves you awestruck.</p>
